# Argo CD

[Argo CD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes.

This folder contains Argo CD OAuth secret, Project settings, and App-of-Apps configurations.  
This files are used in [My home-server install CLI](https://github.com/BeaverHouse/macos-oneclick-install) and not managed by Argo CD itself.
